# Build Notes

1-11-20

My initial design idea is to extend the theme of my LinkedIn profile. It uses a 50's sci-fi theme with a boy and a toy robot. i need to make this a little more professional but I'm considering using the cool factor of retro futuristic design. My concern is that I may not find too many publicly available royalty-free images that meet my needs. For the home page I'd like to go with a hand-drawn blueprint style design of a rocket, with some code superimposed over it, and a 50's toy rocket of the same drawing next to it. This might not work well on a mobile layout so I need to consider the use of space. I'd like the 'above the fold' section of the landing page to have elements of oldschool engineering design, with implied attitude of attention to detail and personal flare.

The index page should have a few distinct sections with scroll links between them,. Use non-horizontal dividers (possibly angled and animated rectangles z-indexed underneath the section divs)

I'd also like some geometric shapes under the menu options to animated in some way of the page to compliment the theme.

The other pages should have a common thread with similar image elements and animations, but different enough to make each page feel fresh.

Color profile: Faded primary colours for accents. Cream for the background. As subtle repeated background motif to extend the desktop version, possibly a wireframe of a 50's robot or similar.
