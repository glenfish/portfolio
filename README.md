### Description of portfolio

This portfolio website showcases professional development knowledge and experience of the subject through a responsive, device-agnostic design aesthetic. 

Its intended audience are IT professionals, prospective employers and clients and recruiters in the IT space. 

__Functionality & Features:__

The site is a 5 page standalone portfolio. It uses no prewritten css or frameworks, the only exception being a normalize.css file

Google web fonts were used, and another web font was used which is locally hosted

The only javascript used was for the FontAwesome functionality, which displays the icon vectors.

There is a simple fade-in animation on the icons at the top of the page. 

The site features a form on the contact page, some videos and links on the Tools page, some screenshot examples of sites I have personaly built on the index and Portfolio pages and a sitemap which is just a link tree.
