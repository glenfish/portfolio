                                In addition to standalone sites I specialise in Wordpress customisations. I like my clients to feel comfortable updating their own content. I also focused on building out mini-sites for lead generation for the education sector and for law firms. My preference has been to use PHP/MySQL for smaller clients since they can run on easy-to-use and affordable Linux hosting. I also have extensive background in e-commerce solutions and have built and customised a web store using Magento that billed over $3M. Other clients I have set up on Shopify and similar platforms. I also have experience dealing with merchant accounts and securely accepting payments online. I have worked with large brands, one of which we pitched a range of beauty products to Walgreens head office in the United States and were successful in receiving placement across their online store and several hundred physical stores nationwide.

                                I'v designed and developed utilities and tools such as a cookie tracking system for affiliate marketing and cost-per-acquisition leads and sales. Integrated into the platform was an SMS service which could send custom data content based on a defined set of actions taken by the web user.

                                Photoshop (and Gimp on Linux) are the tools of the trade when it comes to image editing. I have extensive background in building image assets for web clients, including for print catalogs, books and large format.

                                My background in varied business related roles has allowed me to see the big picture on any given job. There are often many ways to get the job done. Finding and implementing the best solution for any given project is the most important aspect to what I do. I look forward to working with like minded people who need technology solutions or building out your next online business site or app. Please feel free to connect with me on social media or <a href="./contact.html"><span class="link-special">message me</span></a>.
