                            <p>I'm a front end web developer and project manager with experience in online marketing, ecommerce and lead generation. My focus is on tech start-ups, with interests in blockchain, IoT and the new digital economy.</p>

                            <p>A passion for music, electronic instruments, sound processing and audio recording saw my career begin in 1989 as assistant sound engineer at recording facility Studios 301 in Sydney Australia, working for the sound design and music production house, Song Zu. Over the following 13 years I engineered sessions for radio, TV, corporate presentations and EPs/albums.</p>

                            <p>My online career began in 2003, where I worked in Sydney as a digital project manager and within 6 months I was promoted to agency manager. We focused on testing and design to increase conversions for online sales and lead generation of both in-house and third party Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) marketing campaigns.</p>

                            <p>In 2006 I relocated to Chicago (US) to grow our international footprint in a business development role. We expanded into online media buying and branding strategy. In 2007 the agency was acquired by a well known Australian media group.</p>

                            <p>From 2007 to 2010 my focus shifted to business start-ups. My wife and I started children's book club Romeo's World which saw us produce a series of hardcover books and children's toys. I project managed the online systems and designed and built out all web assets for the company Black Dog Books. I then launched a drop-ship perfume business that used an interactive design within Facebook, a 'try before you buy' mini fragrance club called ScentByMe.</p>

                            <p>In 2009 I launched a successful lead generation platform for attorneys and consulted to companies selling goods and services online. 2010-11 I led the marketing division of a computer hardware retailer/wholesaler in Sydney (AU) where we achieved online sales in excess of $3M (AUD). I have been involved in various web design projects and freelance consulting gigs to the present day.</p>

                            <p>My skillset is built upon 17 years of experience across business marketing, design &amp; testing, project management, ecommerce and lead generation. In terms of coding, I am proficient in HTML5 and CSS3 and have experience with Java, Python, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, SASS &amp; Git/Github.</p>

                            <p>I'm interested in how blockchain technology presents new opportunities for start-ups. Currently I'm expanding my coding skills at La Trobe University and Coder Academy in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
